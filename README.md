The Prompt Guided Neural Architecture Search (PG-NAS) is a PyTorch-based framework designed to generate neural network architectures based on textual prompts. It utilizes a prompt encoder to interpret the input prompt and proposes a corresponding architecture with shape tracking. The model supports various layer types, including convolutional, linear, and attention layers.

## Features

- **Prompt-based Architecture Generation**: Generate neural network architectures from natural language prompts.
- **Layer Type Support**: Supports convolutional, linear, and attention layers.
- **Shape Tracking**: Keeps track of input and output shapes throughout the architecture.
- **Weight Initialization**: Automatically initializes weights for each layer based on the proposed architecture.
- **Model Saving and Loading**: Save and load model artifacts, including architecture and configuration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Loguru
- Other dependencies as specified in the code
